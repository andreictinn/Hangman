## Description

The Hangman Game Project is a simple Python program that allows users to play the classic game of Hangman. The project aims to demonstrate basic Python coding skills, including the use of lists, random module, and user input validation.


### Aim of the Project

The primary goal of this project is to provide a simple and enjoyable implementation of the Hangman game. It serves as an interactive and educational way to explore Python programming concepts, including classes, user input handling, and game logic.

### What You'll Learn

By exploring this project, you will:

- Gain insights into Python classes and object-oriented programming
- Understand how to handle user input and validate guesses
- Explore the logic behind Hangman game mechanics

## Installation

To run the Hangman Game, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the `handman_game` file using a Python interpreter.

## Usage

- Upon running the script, the game will prompt you to guess a letter.
- Input a single alphabetical character and press Enter.
- The game will provide feedback on whether your guess is correct or not.
- Continue guessing until you either win the game or run out of lives.
- Enjoy :)

## File Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `hangman_game.py`: The main script containing the Hangman class and game logic. Read comments for further insights into code structure and logic.
- `README.md`: This README file providing project information.
